# My emacs config

This is currently very much a work in progress. The initial push was to break
the single humongous `init.el` file into separate, hopefully logical, pieces.

I've borrowed ideas and snippets from
[cjohansen](https://github.com/cjohansen/.emacs.d),
[technomancy](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults),
[otfrom](https://github.com/otfrom/otfrom-org-emacs) and
[t-ob](https://github.com/t-ob/dotfiles).

## Usage

I like [otfrom's](https://github.com/otfrom) approach of symlinking `~/.emacs.d`
from other directories. This approach is easy and allows trying other people's
configs out.
