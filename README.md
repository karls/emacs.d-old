# My emacs config

This is currently very much a work in progress. The former, single humongous
`init.el` was starting to become unwieldy. The current setup makes
more sense logically and is easier to maintain.

I've borrowed ideas and snippets from
[cjohansen](https://github.com/cjohansen/.emacs.d),
[technomancy](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults),
[otfrom](https://github.com/otfrom/otfrom-org-emacs) and
[t-ob](https://github.com/t-ob/dotfiles).

## Usage

I like [otfrom's](https://github.com/otfrom) approach of symlinking `~/.emacs.d`
from other directories. This approach is easy and allows trying other people's
configs out without much hassle.
